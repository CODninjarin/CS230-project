Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room has a mobile game for android, Draw It or Lose it, that they are wanting to transition to a web based application to allow for more users to interact with the game. The client has no experience with web based programming so recommending easy to use OSs and tools is important. The application requirments are as follows:
  1. A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved. 
  2. Each team will have multiple players assigned to it. 
  3. Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name. 
  4. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I feel I did a decent job overall on the documentation, with the best work being on the domain model and understanding the flow of the program. OSs and how they work is still a new concept to me so I am more comfortable with the coding related aspect of the document.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Having clear requirements and expectations help to lead the direction of development and helps reduce quessing on how things should be done.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the recommendations sections. I have limited knowledge on different OSs and how they work hands on. With more knowledge and experience I would like to give a more detailed response to these recommendations that could be better utilized by the client. Some changes could include recommending Windows over Linux due to the users lack of web development experience, since Linux is a more advanced OS to use, or doing more research into cloud computing and whether it would work better in this situation over a traditional server.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The success of the project depends on the users interaction. With the program being web based it's important to make sure it runs effectively on the most popular OSs, primarily Windows. User experience is also taken into account with server choice due to the potential downtimes that they could introduce. In my recommendations I recommended a physical server due to the size of the project and the cost of cloud storage/servers, but if the program were to expand I would recommend a cloud solution to limit downtimes due to updates and upgrades.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  This being my first look at this kind of document and taskI did a lot of research on the different systems involved and compared both educational and user views on them, along with my firsthand knowledge, for recommendations. Even if I had knowledge of these systems, research is an important part of any softwares design and development due to the rapidly changing nature of technology.
